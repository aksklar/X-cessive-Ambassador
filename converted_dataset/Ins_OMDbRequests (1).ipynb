These are signs of the Apocalypse and the Vatican is investigating, but Father Lucci advises that these omens are hoax or technologically explained. In California, the housewife Abby Quinn is pregnant and the delivery is scheduled to February, 29 in a leap year. Her husband, the lawyer Russell Quinn, is defending a weird case of the teenager Jimmy Szaragosa that killed his parents telling that he was following the Word of God. Meanwhile Abby rents a garage apartment to the mysterious David Bannon. The hopeless Abby has strange nightmares and soon she finds that around the world there are signs of the Apocalypse in accordance with the Book of Revelation. She learns also that David Bannon is Jesus that has returned; Father Lucci is the Pilate's porter Cartaphilus that was doomed to wander on Earth for the eternity; and she is a woman that tried to help Jesus. Further, she is the Seventh Sign and the Apocalypse will happen when her baby is stillborn. What can she do to save her unborn son and mankind?\",\n",
